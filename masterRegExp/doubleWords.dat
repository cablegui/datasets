In many regular-expr ession flavors, parentheses can remember text matched by
the subexpression they enclose. We'll use this in a partial solution to the doubledword
problem at the beginning of this chapter. If you knew the the specic doubled
word to nd (such as the earlier in this sentence  did you catch it?), you
could search for it explicitly, such as with !the the". In this case, you would also such such
nd items such as the theory, but you could easily get around that problem if
your egr ep supports the word-boundary metasequences !\<\>" mentioned on as as
page 15: !\<the the\>". We could use ! +" for the space for even more exibility.
